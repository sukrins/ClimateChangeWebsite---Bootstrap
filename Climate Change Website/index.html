            <p class="leads">Climate change refers to any long-term change in Earth's climate, or in the climate of a region or city. This includes warming, cooling and changes besides temperature. Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the preset.<br><br>
            Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter. Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours.</p>

            <br><br>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>Heatwaves</h2>
                  <p>
                     Heatwaves are one of the more direct consequences of global warming affecting senior citizens. More so than other populations, heatwaves can lead to severe heat strokes and dehydration in the elderly.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <br>
                <li>
                  <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
                  <p>
                     The change in air quality can be a hard adjustment for older citizens especially those who grew up in a different climate. Specially since pollution from industrial waste includes harmful chemicals that can damage lung tissues, and more.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <br>
                <li>
                  <h2>Social Isolation</h2>
                  <p>
                     Seniors who live on their own do not always have access to help in emergency situations. Therefore, during weather emergencies, they are often stuck without access to basic services or a way out.
                  </p>

                  <h2>New Diseases</h2>
                  <p>
                     Older adults are more susceptible and less likely to make a full recovery from the newer and more dangerous forms of animal, air and water borne diseases due to climate change.

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h2>Wide-ranging Health Impacts</h2>
                  <p>
                     Climate change threatens human health and well-being in many ways, including impacts from increased extreme weather events, wildfire, decreased air quality, threats to mental health, and illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease-carriers such as mosquitoes and ticks. Some of these health impacts are already underway in the United States.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <br>
                <li>
                  <h2>Most Vulnerable at Most Risk</h2>
                  <p>
                     Climate change will, absent other changes, amplify some of the existing health threats the nation now faces. Certain people and communities are especially vulnerable, including children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <br>
                <li>
                  <h2>Allergies and Asthma</h2>
                  <p>
                     Climate change, as well as increased CO2 by itself, can contribute to increased production of plant-based allergens. Higher pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons can increase allergic sensitizations and asthma episodes and diminish productive work and school days.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <br>
                  <h2>Food and Waterborne Diarrheal Disease</h2>
                  <p>
                     Diarrheal disease is a major public health issue in developing countries and while not generally increasing in the United States, remains a persistent concern nonetheless. Exposure to a variety of pathogens in water and food causes diarrheal disease.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <br>
                <li>
                  <h2>Diseases Carried by Vectors</h2>
                  <p>
                     Climate is one of the factors that influences the distribution of diseases borne by vectors (such as fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes, which spread pathogens that cause illness). The geographic and seasonal distribution of vector populations, and the diseases they can carry, depend not only on climate, but also on land use, socioeconomic and cultural factors, pest control, access to health care, and human responses to disease risk, among other factors.
